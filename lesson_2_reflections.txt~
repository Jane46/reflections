Reflections - Lesson 2 - version-control


===================================================
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
========================================================

A .git directory is created. You create the repository to keep a record of all changes to all tracked files. A git commit is a snapshot of a git repository. These are services that just having files in a folder can't perform.


=======================================================
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
==========================================

The staging area shows you which files will be included in a commit. This would help prevent unintentional additions to your repository.
